The output `drwxr-xr-x. 1 taipan taipan 86 Jun 13 04:17 tryingLinux` is a line from the `ls -l` command in Linux, which provides a detailed listing of files and directories. Here's a breakdown of what each part of this line means:

1. **`drwxr-xr-x.`**:
    
    - `d`: Indicates that this is a directory.
    - `rwx`: The owner (first set of permissions) has read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions.
    - `r-x`: The group (second set of permissions) has read (r) and execute (x) permissions, but not write (w) permissions.
    - `r-x`: Others (third set of permissions) have read (r) and execute (x) permissions, but not write (w) permissions.
    - `.`: SELinux context (Security-Enhanced Linux), indicating extended attributes.
2. **`1`**:
    
    - Number of hard links to the directory. This is typically 1 plus the number of subdirectories.
3. **`taipan`**:
    
    - The owner of the directory.
4. **`taipan`**:
    
    - The group associated with the directory.
5. **`86`**:
    
    - The size of the directory in bytes. Note that this is not the total size of all the files within the directory but the size of the directory entry itself.
6. **`Jun 13 04:17`**:
    
    - The date and time when the directory was last modified.
7. **`tryingLinux`**:
    
    - The name of the directory.

- **Group (`r-x`)**:
    
    - `r`: Members of the group can read the contents of the directory.
    - `x`: Members of the group can enter the directory.
    - They cannot create, delete, or rename files within the directory.
- **Others (`r-x`)**:
    
    - `r`: Others can read the contents of the directory.
    - `x`: Others can enter the directory.
    - They cannot create, delete, or rename files within the directory.

SHABANG -> #! 
executables -> bash,ksh,sh,dash all have different syntax but not really different 
most widely used is bash

#!/bin/bash
change the permissions
chmod 700 file.sh
chmod +x file.sh

./file.sh


*Advance bash scripting*
df -> available disk space
free -> free space
nproc -> number of cpu
top -> like task manager

set -x 
echo "print the disk space"
df
echo "print the free space"
free
echo "print the number of computer"
nproc
ps -ef | grep "python" >> output.txt

awk -> prints specific parts of output 
 ps -ef | grep "python" | awk -F " " '{print $2}'
 
set -e -> exit the script when there is an error 
set -o pipefail 
curl 
wget 
find / -name
